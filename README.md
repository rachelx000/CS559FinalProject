## Application of Persistent Homology in the Diagnosis of Breast Cancer from Mammography

This project evaluates the use of topological data analysis (TDA) in persistent homology for breast cancer diagnosis. The results demonstrate that persistent homology effectively captures significant topological features in mammograms, aiding in the differentiation between benign and malignant breast cancer. Both full persistent homology and $beta_0$ persistent features capture these diagnostic details, while $beta_1$  persistent features are less effective, likely because tumors and microcalcifications are dense components rather than holes. This highlights the potential of incorporating persistent homology into computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis systems.
